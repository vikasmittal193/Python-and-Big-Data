Task
Complete the Difference class by writing the following:

A class constructor that takes an array of integers as a parameter and saves it to the  instance variable.
A computeDifference method that finds the maximum absolute difference between any  numbers in  and stores it in the  instance variable.

        max_int = max(self.__elements)
        self.maximumDifference = max_int - min_int
